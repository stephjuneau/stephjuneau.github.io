## Welcome!

I am an Associate Astronomer at [NSF's NOIRLab](https://noirlab.edu/), as well as a Survey Data Scientist in the [Astro Data Lab](https://datalab.noao.edu) team.

### Research

My research interests focus on galaxy evolution. I am especially intrigued by the way galaxies formed and assembled their stars as well as by the interplay between star formation and active accretion around super-massive black holes at the center of galaxies â€” or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).

### Publications

I have authored and co-authored 109 publications, 79 of which are peer reviewed. The full publication list is available on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22juneau%2Cs.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).
