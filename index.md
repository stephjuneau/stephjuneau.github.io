## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/stephjuneau/stephjuneau.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
